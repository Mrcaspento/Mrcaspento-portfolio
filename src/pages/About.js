    Born in Newark, NJ in 1994.I lived there for 5 years before my parents decided to move my twin sister and me to South Carolina looking for a better life, or avoid paying higher taxes. Grew up in Myrtle Beach, Sc and went to Coastal Carolina Unversity for Biochemistery until 2018 where I moved to Charlotte, NC and decided to become a bar manager.
