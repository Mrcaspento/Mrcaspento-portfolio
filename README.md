## My Portfolio

  My past endeavors have aligned with my passions in becoming a Software engineer, allowing me to let loose my artistic expression in all kinds of mediums. My leadership role at Halcyon allowed me to hone in my project management skills. I was able to come up with new ideas and concepts in the short time frame allotted and quickly adapt to the speed bumps that presented themselves along the way. Through this and other similar experiences, I have had the opportunity to showcase these abilities. I acquired the Certificate in “Full-Stack Web Development” from UNCC. I was able to utilize my understanding of technologies coupled with my passion for achievement. I led my project teams to go beyond what was required and we implemented friendly UI and mobile first. My Brand is the passion that drives me to identify ever-changing problems and find innovative solutions.
